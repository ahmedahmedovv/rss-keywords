The ability to adapt is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the military is able to respond effectively to changing circumstances. (…) After two years and, in a moment, after three years of experience of the war in Ukraine, there must be an analysis and redefinition of the actions we are conducting - stated Deputy Prime Minister W.

It is imperative that Europe intensifies its efforts to provide assistance to Ukraine, with a particular focus on enhancing its security. Without increased expenditure and awareness of the necessity of such measures within the European public consciousness, the aforementioned measures will prove futile. Without an awareness of the importance of security in the contemporary era. It is our intention to reiterate this message at every opportunity, and it is our commitment as defence ministers to do so. It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States. I would like this to be emphasised, as we have all previously stated in our speeches how important it is for us to maintain relations with the United States, which have been the basis of our civilisation for many years - said Deputy Prime Minister W.

The total cost of modernization (including the purchase of necessary equipment, test and training weapons, and services) was estimated at a maximum of USD 7 billion net (approx.

Unfortunately, in reality we spend less on defence because the given values ​​referred only to the expenditure plan, and in addition, part of the defence expenditure incurred from the Armed Forces Support Fund (FWSZ) is counted twice, once for the payment of advances and deliveries of military equipment, and the second time for servicing the debt incurred to purchase this military equipment, i.e. for: commissions, interest, debt repayment and operating costs of the FWSZ. In the author's opinion, expenditure on servicing the FWSZ debt should not be included in defence expenditure, but in the part of the state budget related to debt servicing.",

    "description": "During the XXXII International Defence Industry Exhibition held in Kielce, PIT-RADWAR S.A. publicly presented for the first time the prototype of the Multifunctional Fire Control Radar (RWKO) Sajna. It was developed based on development work commissioned in December 2012 and is to be the basic sensor of the short-range ground-based air defence system Kr. Narew. Its role will be to detect, identify and track objects, as well as to initially guide anti-aircraft missiles to them. Initial tests of the radar are currently underway, after which it must still undergo qualification tests, the positive result of which will determine the possibility of concluding a contract for supplies by the Armament Agency.",
