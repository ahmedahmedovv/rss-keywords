They could serve this state or, above all, part of its elites (led by factions around the Revolutionary Guards) to block the actions of Israel, the US, but also at least some Arab states. We are talking about **treating a number of terrorist and non-state structures as tools** in asymmetric actions. Aware of their lower potential in relation to potential opponents. At the forefront, at some point of this highly developed architecture, was of course Hezbollah, which was a kind of model of conduct in other cases. **Hezbollah was so important because, as a terrorist structure 2.0, it was integrated into the Lebanese state system** in political, social, military and intelligence terms, but also economically (including in terms of organized crime activities). Allowing it to conduct its own de facto policy on the border with Israel, but also necessary to influence, for example, the civil war in Syria.",

    "description": "**Piotr Andrusieczko: Gazeta Wyborcza: \"Ukrainians are counterattacking\"**\n&#8222;The Ukrainian army has begun a new phase of operations on Russian territory. On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

Russia, on the other hand, managed to take selected key cities in the south in early March 2022: Kherson, Melitopol, and - after prolonged urban fighting - also Mariupol in May.",

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

    "description": "The nuclear policies of major powers have been widely discussed in recent months, highlighting the growing importance of NATO’s strategy in the face of modern competition. While the Alliance remains committed to pursuing a world without nuclear weapons, the current security environment compels it to maintain and reinforce deterrence to counter the ambitions of Russia, China, and other states expanding their nuclear arsenals. NATO also opposes the weaponization of outer space, warning against the destabilizing effects such actions could have on global security. Despite Russia’s modernization of its nuclear arsenal and attempts to use coercion and nuclear blackmail, NATO continues to strengthen its defensive capabilities.",

He notes, however, that procurement should be reviewed regarding the volume of orders, and plans should be adjusted if necessary. He highlights the cessation of using the military for partisan politics and improved relations between the MoD and the president’s BBN as significant positives. The lack of updated strategic documents, however, is a notable shortfall.",

Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "title": "The End of Syria as We Know It",
    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",
