    "description": "Viki Gabor won the hearts of Poles with her great performances in The Voice Kids and her victory at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. She is a star of the young generation who has become one of the most recognizable people in Polish show business in an extremely short time. She is only 16 years old, lives with her family in Krakow, and has many spectacular successes under her belt. On stage, she behaves like a world-class star, but what is she like in private? She stands out from the crowd and has a unique style - that's for sure. She loves animals and has a big heart for them. She recently adopted a little kitten from a shelter, and this gesture was appreciated by thousands of Internet users. She has a large group of devoted fans, but she also arouses controversy. Recently, there was a lot of talk about a small media conflict between Viki Gabor and Roksana Węgiel. The young singers argued about their approach to music and show business. Go to the photo gallery and see how Wiktoria Gabor lives her daily life!",
