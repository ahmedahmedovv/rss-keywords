We are talking about **treating a number of terrorist and non-state structures as tools** in asymmetric actions. Aware of their lower potential in relation to potential opponents. At the forefront, at some point of this highly developed architecture, was of course Hezbollah, which was a kind of model of conduct in other cases. **Hezbollah was so important because, as a terrorist structure 2.0, it was integrated into the Lebanese state system** in political, social, military and intelligence terms, but also economically (including in terms of organized crime activities). Allowing it to conduct its own de facto policy on the border with Israel, but also necessary to influence, for example, the civil war in Syria.",

Despite the modernization of Russia’s nuclear arsenal and attempts to use nuclear coercion and blackmail, NATO continues to strengthen its defense capabilities. The alliance is investing in the modernization of its strategic and tactical nuclear forces and developing conventional military capabilities, such as the F-35A, which increase deterrence. NATO combines these investments with updated decision-making procedures and transparent communication to minimize the risk of escalation.",

On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "title": "The End of Syria as We Know It",
    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",

The ability to adapt is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the military is able to respond effectively to changing circumstances.

It is imperative that Europe intensifies its efforts to provide assistance to Ukraine, with a particular focus on enhancing its security. Without increased expenditure and awareness of the necessity of such measures within the European public consciousness, the aforementioned measures will prove futile. Without an awareness of the importance of security in the contemporary era. It is our intention to reiterate this message at every opportunity, and it is our commitment as defence ministers to do so. It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States. I would like this to be emphasised, as we have all previously stated in our speeches how important it is for us to maintain relations with the United States, which have been the basis of our civilisation for many years - said Deputy Prime Minister W.

Never. I know and realize that there are no words that could encompass the pain of losing a husband, father or son. These are soldiers and civilian employees of the Polish Army.

IU/77/X-89/ZS/NEGZ/USŁ/Z/2015/408 with the consortium of PGZ S.A. and ZM Bumar-Łabędy S.A. for the renovation and modernization of 128 Leopard 2A4 tanks to the Leopard 2PL version in 2018-2020 with an option to modernize 14 more tanks in 2021. The initial value of the contract was PLN 2.415 billion gross (without options). On 20 June 2018, Annex No. 2 to the aforementioned contract was concluded, which activated the option and extended the scope of work, without changing the order implementation period, as a result of which the value of the contract increased to PLN 2.721 billion gross. The current status of this order and how its completion date and value have changed are described later in the article.",

Unfortunately, in reality we spend less on defence because the given values ​​referred only to the expenditure plan, and in addition, part of the defence expenditure incurred from the Armed Forces Support Fund (FWSZ) is counted twice, once for the payment of advances and deliveries of military equipment, and the second time for servicing the debt incurred to purchase this military equipment, i.e. for: commissions, interest, debt repayment and operating costs of the FWSZ. In the author's opinion, expenditure on servicing the FWSZ debt should not be included in defence expenditure, but in the part of the state budget related to debt servicing.",

On the other hand, the postponement of the implementation date of the National e-Invoice System (KSeF), which was to be in force from mid-2024, is primarily received positively. The advantages also include a lower VAT rate in the beauty industry, cash PIT for the smallest companies and the minimum CIT tax. The latter is also on the list of disadvantages.

The Security Service of Ukraine published recordings from the vicinity of Pokrovsk, where the Russians were attacked by missiles and combat drones. Interestingly, the defenders of Kiev used a \"home-made\" Sivalka VM-8 rocket launcher to fire. It is capable of firing 16 missiles. It uses 80 mm S-8 rockets, which are usually fired from military aircraft or helicopters, and in this case they were fired from a launcher mounted on a Ukrainian vehicle. The most common solution among missiles are high-explosive fragmentation variants. There is also no shortage of S-8DF thermobaric warheads and S-8T anti-tank warheads with a tandem cumulative warhead that easily burns through reactive armor. This type of missile was specifically designed for the attack in the recording. In addition, three combat drone operators targeted a 9K37 Buk system that was going to take up position to attack Ukrainian targets. However, General Syrski's soldiers were faster and with controlled strikes tore the occupiers' weapons to pieces.",

In the case of Szczucki, Prosecutor Adamiak reported that when he was president of the Government Legislation Center, he employed people he indicated in the established Department of Education and Communication without a competitive procedure. Additionally, these people did not work for the RCL and instead \"provided assistance to the MP in his election campaign by organizing meetings and undertaking promotional activities.\" In the program \"Tłit\" WP, the PiS MP spoke on this matter. - I want to clear my name as soon as possible and I hope that the prosecutor or the court will honestly listen to what I have to say and the case will be closed once and for all - said Szczucki. The host of the program, Michał Wróblewski, asked if the politician intends to waive his immunity. - I am inclined to do so, it will probably be so. I only received an application to waive my immunity this week, so I am still in the process of analyzing it - replied the guest of the program. He explained that he wanted to clarify this matter anyway, so \"involving the entire Sejm in this makes no sense\". Referring to the allegations, Szczucki stated that it is \"absolutely untrue\". - This is the thesis that allegedly RCL employees did nothing, which is absolutely untrue, this notorious department, about which so much is said, organized numerous trainings, workshops, seminars - he added.",
