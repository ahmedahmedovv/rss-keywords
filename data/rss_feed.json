    "description": "Viki Gabor won the hearts of Poles with her great performances in The Voice Kids and her victory at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. She is a star of the young generation who has become one of the most recognizable people in Polish show business in an extremely short time. She is only 16 years old, lives with her family in Krakow, and has many spectacular successes under her belt. On stage, she behaves like a world-class star, but what is she like in private? She stands out from the crowd and has a unique style - that's for sure. She loves animals and has a big heart for them. She recently adopted a little kitten from a shelter, and this gesture was appreciated by thousands of Internet users. She has a large group of devoted fans, but she also arouses controversy. Recently, there was a lot of talk about a small media conflict between Viki Gabor and Roksana Węgiel. The young singers argued about their approach to music and show business. Go to the photo gallery and see how Wiktoria Gabor lives her daily life!",

We are talking about **treating a number of terrorist and non-state structures as tools** in asymmetric actions. Aware of their lower potential in relation to potential opponents. At the forefront, at some point of this highly developed architecture, was of course Hezbollah, which was a kind of model of conduct in other cases. **Hezbollah was so important because, as a terrorist structure 2.0, it was integrated into the Lebanese state system** in political, social, military and intelligence terms, but also economically (including in terms of organized crime activities).

Despite the modernization of Russia’s nuclear arsenal and attempts to use nuclear coercion and blackmail, NATO is constantly strengthening its defense capabilities. The alliance is investing in the modernization of its strategic and tactical nuclear forces and developing conventional military capabilities, such as the F-35A, which increase deterrence. NATO is combining these investments with updated decision-making procedures and transparent communication to minimize the risk of escalation.",

On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

NATO also opposes the weaponization of outer space, warning against the destabilizing effects such actions could have on global security. Despite Russia’s modernization of its nuclear arsenal and attempts to use coercion and nuclear blackmail, NATO continues to strengthen its defensive capabilities.",

This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",

And their families – those who come here every year, those who stand before this monument every year with a pensive face, with tears in their eyes and with a heart that will never find solace after the loss of loved ones. Never. I know and realize that there are no words that could encompass the pain of losing a husband, father or son. These are soldiers and civilian employees of the Polish Army.

The total amount planned for defense next year from the state budget and the Armed Forces Support Fund (FWSZ) is PLN 186.5 billion, which is to constitute 4.7% of Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) planned in 2025 (in the amount of PLN 3,973.1 billion) and 18.7% of the total expenditure of the state budget and FWSZ.

The ability to adapt is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the military is able to respond effectively to changing circumstances.

Without increased expenditure and awareness of the necessity of such measures within the European public consciousness, the aforementioned measures will prove futile. Without an awareness of the importance of security in the contemporary era. It is our intention to reiterate this message at every opportunity, and it is our commitment as defence ministers to do so. It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States.

In the case of Szczucki, Prosecutor Adamiak reported that when he was president of the Government Legislation Center, he employed people he indicated in the established Department of Education and Communication without a competitive procedure. Additionally, these people did not work for the RCL and instead \"provided assistance to the MP in his election campaign by organizing meetings and undertaking promotional activities.\" In the program \"Tłit\" WP, the PiS MP spoke on this matter. - I want to clear my name as soon as possible and I hope that the prosecutor or the court will honestly listen to what I have to say and the case will be closed once and for all - said Szczucki. The host of the program, Michał Wróblewski, asked if the politician intends to waive his immunity. - I am inclined to do so, it will probably be so. I only received an application to waive my immunity this week, so I am still in the process of analyzing it - replied the guest of the program. He explained that he wanted to clarify this matter anyway, so \"involving the entire Sejm in this makes no sense\". Referring to the allegations, Szczucki stated that it is \"absolutely untrue\". - This is the thesis that allegedly RCL employees did nothing, which is absolutely untrue, this notorious department, about which so much is said, organized numerous trainings, workshops, seminars - he added.",
