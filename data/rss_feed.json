The alliance is investing in the modernization of its strategic and tactical nuclear forces and developing conventional military capabilities, such as the F-35A, which increase deterrence.

On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

In the first stage, the Russian Federation's armed forces failed to take Kiev, and the Ukrainian counterattack caused significant losses in equipment for the Russian side. Russia, on the other hand, managed to take selected key cities in the south in early March 2022: Kherson, Melitopol, and - after prolonged urban fighting - also Mariupol in May.",

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

    "description": "Single pages from a soldier's notebook have been appearing since before the holiday season. At that time, the Ukrainian Special Forces showed a page with a hand-drawn drawing depicting \"fighting drones\". The latest disclosed notes reveal a bit more about the very purpose for which North Korean soldiers are fighting and dying in Ukraine. According to the notes of the fallen soldier, it is about \"experience\" that they will gain and can use in a potential war.",

    "description": "As we learn from the 1WBP social media, on January 2, the unit's duty service had to cope with an unusual task. One of the soldiers of the DSW specialist training, voluntarily barracked on the unit's premises, began to give birth. Colleagues reacted quickly, calling an ambulance and providing the necessary assistance to the future mother. The delivery was quick and without major complications, the mother and the new recruit are feeling great. The entire unit is already starting to prepare a layette for the girl. As we learn unofficially, an assignment to communications is being prepared, \"people need to be united, not divided\" - the soldiers admit.",

    "description": "“The Worst Year of the War” – this is how I titled the summary of the last few months on the front. Unfortunately, the case of the 155th Anna Kyivska Brigade caused a huge stir in Ukraine and confirmed that things were going badly on the Ukrainian side of the front. The case will also resonate in Ukrainian-French relations. President Emmanuel Macron recently experienced a pro-Ukrainian awakening. He stopped calling Vladimir Putin and became a second Napoleon Bonaparte, encouraging resistance to Russia, being in the vanguard of European leaders in the defense of Ukraine. The fruit of this transformation was the project of training and arming the 155th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by France. The numbering of the brigade itself was unlucky, because when I read that the French would train the “155”, I thought that they should not end up like the Russian marines. Let me remind you that the Russian 155th Marine Brigade was approximately 80 percent destroyed during the current war.",
