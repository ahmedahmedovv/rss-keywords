The alliance is investing in the modernization of its strategic and tactical nuclear forces and developing conventional military capabilities, such as the F-35A, which increase deterrence.

On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas.

In the first stage, the Russian Federation's armed forces failed to take Kiev, and the Ukrainian counterattack caused significant losses in equipment for the Russian side.

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

The latest disclosed notes reveal a bit more about the very purpose for which North Korean soldiers are fighting and dying in Ukraine. According to the notes of the fallen soldier, it is about \"experience\" that they will gain and be able to use in a potential war.",

One of the soldiers of the DSW specialist training, voluntarily barracked on the unit's premises, began to give birth. Colleagues reacted quickly, calling an ambulance and providing the necessary assistance to the future mother. The delivery was quick and without major complications, the mother and the new recruit are feeling great. The entire unit is already starting to prepare a layette for the girl. As we learn unofficially, an assignment to communications is being prepared, \"people need to be united, not divided\" - the soldiers admit.",

    "description": "“The Worst Year of the War” – this is how I titled the summary of the last few months on the front. Unfortunately, the case of the 155th Anna Kyivska Brigade caused a huge stir in Ukraine and confirmed that things were going badly on the Ukrainian side of the front. The case will also resonate in Ukrainian-French relations. President Emmanuel Macron recently experienced a pro-Ukrainian awakening. He stopped calling Vladimir Putin and became a second Napoleon Bonaparte, encouraging resistance to Russia, being in the vanguard of European leaders in the defense of Ukraine. The fruit of this transformation was the project of training and arming the 155th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by France. The numbering of the brigade itself was unlucky, because when I read that the French would train the “155”, I thought that they should not end up like the Russian marines. Let me remind you that the Russian 155th Marine Brigade was approximately 80 percent destroyed during the current war.",

Why? Because until the end of last year, they could have withdrawn the money invested in the purchase, installation and connection of such boilers from the tribute due to the tax office. Now it turns out that at the beginning of 2025, such boilers disappeared from the list of expenses covered by tax relief. Will the owners of gas and oil furnaces go to court? The point is that an error was made in the regulations.",

While the Alliance remains committed to pursuing a world without nuclear weapons, the current security environment compels it to maintain and reinforce deterrence to counter the ambitions of Russia, China, and other states expanding their nuclear arsenals. NATO also opposes the weaponization of outer space, warning against the destabilizing effects such actions could have on global security. Despite Russia’s modernization of its nuclear arsenal and attempts to use coercion and nuclear blackmail, NATO continues to strengthen its defensive capabilities.",

He notes, however, that procurement should be reviewed regarding the volume of orders, and plans should be adjusted if necessary. He highlights the cessation of using the military for partisan politics and improved relations between the MoD and the president’s BBN as significant positives. The lack of updated strategic documents, however, is a notable shortfall.",

Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",

It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States.

Poland is a reliable ally, and we are committed to upholding our obligations as set forth in the North Atlantic Treaty. We expect the same level of commitment from our allies. The most pressing security concerns were discussed, and I also delivered a presentation on the provision of assistance to Ukraine. I emphasised that Poland has been providing support to Ukraine since the outset of the conflict, implementing a whole range of possible measures to assist the country. On behalf of the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, General Dymanowski presented details of the support provided to Ukraine. The Secretary General and his delegation were highly impressed by Poland's actions since the outset of the war in Ukraine – W.

This means that the value of the planned contract for the MLU modernization of Polish F-16s should be significantly lower than the given amount.",

    "description": "During a press conference held on October 4 this year under the slogan \"Polish Army 2024\", Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that Poland's defense spending \"is at a record level\", and this statement was illustrated by a slide showing the spending: in 2023 at the level of PLN 137.1 billion (3.9% of GDP), in 2024 PLN 158.8 billion (4.2% of GDP), and in 2025 PLN 186.6 billion (4.7%). Unfortunately, in reality we spend less on defence because the given values ​​referred only to the expenditure plan, and in addition, part of the defence expenditure incurred from the Armed Forces Support Fund (FWSZ) is counted twice, once for the payment of advances and deliveries of military equipment, and the second time for servicing the debt incurred to purchase this military equipment, i.e. for: commissions, interest, debt repayment and operating costs of the FWSZ. In the author's opinion, expenditure on servicing the FWSZ debt should not be included in defence expenditure, but in the part of the state budget related to debt servicing.",
