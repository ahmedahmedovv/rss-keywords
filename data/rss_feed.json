On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

    "description": "In December of last year, information appeared in the Czech media about difficulties in implementing the program to purchase Leopard 2A8 tanks by the local Ministry of Defense. This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

Unfortunately, the case of the 155th Anna Kyivska Brigade caused a huge stir in Ukraine and confirmed that things were going badly on the Ukrainian side of the front. The case will also resonate in Ukrainian-French relations. President Emmanuel Macron recently experienced a pro-Ukrainian awakening. He stopped calling Vladimir Putin and became a second Napoleon Bonaparte, encouraging resistance to Russia, being in the vanguard of European leaders in the defense of Ukraine. The fruit of this transformation was the project of training and arming the 155th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by France. The numbering of the brigade itself was unlucky, because when I read that the French would train the “155”, I thought that they should not end up like the Russian marines. Let me remind you that the Russian 155th Marine Brigade was approximately 80 percent destroyed during the current war.",

While the Alliance remains committed to pursuing a world without nuclear weapons, the current security environment compels it to maintain and reinforce deterrence to counter the ambitions of Russia, China, and other states expanding their nuclear arsenals. NATO also opposes the weaponization of outer space, warning against the destabilizing effects such actions could have on global security. Despite Russia’s modernization of its nuclear arsenal and attempts to use coercion and nuclear blackmail, NATO continues to strengthen its defensive capabilities.",

Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",

The main objective is to create conditions in which **the prisoner rejects violence and the desire to integrate with terrorists by participating in individualized behavioral monitoring**, with the involvement of a social support group (social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, educators, as well as researchers and religious scholars), and in exceptional cases also family and loved ones.",
