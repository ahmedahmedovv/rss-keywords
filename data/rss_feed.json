On Sunday morning, information about an intensified Ukrainian offensive has been coming in. The first to report this were Russian propaganda war correspondents and bloggers. According to them, Ukrainian forces were attacking north of Sudzha towards the town of Bolshoye Soldatskoye, which is located on the route leading to Kursk. Ukrainian soldiers first used equipment with minesweepers to clear the area to allow tanks and armored personnel carriers to pass through. Russian information also indicates that the Ukrainian side is using powerful electronic warfare (EEW) means, preventing the Russians from using combat drones with wireless communication. The village of Bolshoye Soldatskoye is located 35 kilometers from the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. Some Russian commentators, as they did in the summer, are again writing that the target of the Ukrainian attack may be a power plant located near Kurchatov. Other Russian bloggers report that the Ukrainians are attacking in several areas. This was confirmed by the head of the Ukrainian Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the Security Council, Andriy Kovalenko. \"In Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked in several directions and it was a surprise to them. The Defense Forces are working,\" Kovalenko wrote in Telegram.",

The situation was complicated by the support that North Korea provided to the Russians last fall. As a result, the Russians managed to approach Sudja. However, in order to delay the attack on that city, Ukrainian forces took new offensive actions on January 5.",

In the first stage, the Russian Federation's armed forces failed to take Kiev, and the Ukrainian counterattack caused significant losses in equipment for the Russian side. Russia, on the other hand, managed to take selected key cities in the south in early March 2022: Kherson, Melitopol, and - after prolonged urban fighting - also Mariupol in May.",

This is said to be due to a smaller than originally planned defense budget for 2025, which is to amount to CZK 154 billion (plus another 6 billion from other departments) instead of the planned 169 billion. In dollars, we are talking about 6.32 billion (plus 246 million) compared to the planned 6.93 billion. Thus, the implementation of several large projects is not at risk, but one of the potential victims is the purchase of the latest version of the Leopard 2.",

    "description": "“The Worst Year of the War” – this is how I titled the summary of the last few months on the front. Unfortunately, the case of the 155th Anna Kyivska Brigade caused a huge stir in Ukraine and confirmed that things were going badly on the Ukrainian side of the front. The case will also resonate in Ukrainian-French relations. President Emmanuel Macron recently experienced a pro-Ukrainian awakening. He stopped calling Vladimir Putin and became a second Napoleon Bonaparte, encouraging resistance to Russia, being in the vanguard of European leaders in the defense of Ukraine. The fruit of this transformation was the project of training and arming the 155th Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by France. The numbering of the brigade itself was unlucky, because when I read that the French would train the “155”, I thought that they should not end up like the Russian marines. Let me remind you that the Russian 155th Marine Brigade was approximately 80 percent destroyed during the current war.",

NATO also opposes the weaponization of outer space, warning against the destabilizing effects such actions could have on global security.

Since 2022, Polish foreign policy and diplomacy have been primarily focused on Eastern Europe and issues directly or indirectly linked to the Russian-Ukrainian war. This focus was evident in the 2024 policy address by Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, where other global regions (apart from the Indo-Pacific) were mentioned only briefly. However, in competing with Moscow, it is crucial to engage partners located thousands of kilometers away from Warsaw. Morocco, the most pro-Western country in North Africa, is one such partner.",

    "description": "At the time of writing, rumors of Assad’s death remain unconfirmed, but it appears he did not reach Latakia (by the time of publication, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Assad had been granted asylum in Moscow - editor’s note). Indications suggest that the Alawites chose not to resist in the coastal strip encompassing Latakia and Tartus, where Russian bases are located. Does this mark the end of Russia’s presence in Syria? Possibly, though much depends on agreements between Russia and Turkey. Even if such agreements exist, Russia may still lose these bases if other factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reject them. While most Syrians harbor negative views of Russia, many are equally opposed to the prospect of their country being dominated by Turkey and its pro-Turkish jihadists from the Syrian National Army (SNA), which, unlike HTS, is notorious for looting, lack of discipline, and atrocities.  This bolsters HTS’s chances of dominance despite its jihadist origins linked to al-Qaeda. Regardless of how the issue of Russia’s military presence in Syria is resolved, the current situation can be exploited both by and against Russia, propaganda-wise. On one hand, if the worst-case scenario (massacres, chaos, factional warfare) unfolds, Russia will blame the West as the supposed architect of these events. On the other, pro-Russian authoritarian regimes, particularly Iran and Shia forces in Iraq (persuaded by Russian ambassador Kutrashev’s propaganda), should receive a clear message: Russia is an unreliable ally, and relying on it is a mistake.",

    "description": "There are currently four possible scenarios for the final outcome of the war between Russia and Ukraine: a long war, a frozen conflict, a Ukrainian victory, and a Ukrainian defeat. Regardless of which of them comes true, far-reaching and traumatic social, sociological, economic, and political consequences will be inevitable. Every war affects the emotions of society, everyday life, public opinion, interpersonal relations, the socio-economic situation, the labor market, and civic activity. Ukraine will have to face these challenges after the end of hostilities in order to maintain the unity of the country, strengthen institutions, and rebuild the economy. These problems may prove more difficult to overcome than the war itself, and their consequences will be felt not only in Ukraine but also in neighboring countries, especially Poland.",

    "description": "- It is our duty today to state this matter clearly and explicitly. It is imperative that Europe intensifies its efforts to provide assistance to Ukraine, with a particular focus on enhancing its security. Without increased expenditure and awareness of the necessity of such measures within the European public consciousness, the aforementioned measures will prove futile. Without an awareness of the importance of security in the contemporary era. It is our intention to reiterate this message at every opportunity, and it is our commitment as defence ministers to do so. It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States. I would like this to be emphasised, as we have all previously stated in our speeches how important it is for us to maintain relations with the United States, which have been the basis of our civilisation for many years - said Deputy Prime Minister W. Kosiniak-Kamysz following a meeting with defence ministers in Berlin.",

I am very pleased to be in Bratislava today, accompanied by Minister of Infrastructure Dariusz Klimczak, who is currently engaged in bilateral discussions. This is not a mere coincidence; it is the result of a strategic decision to cooperate, particularly in the field of arms production. I am particularly impressed by Slovakia's production capacity in the field of ammunition, particularly the 155mm variety, although other types are also noteworthy. The potential for growth is considerable, ranking among the largest in Europe and the world. We wish to collaborate with you in the development of the arms industry, as you represent a strategic partner in this field - stated Deputy Prime Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz following a meeting with Slovak Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák.",

It is noteworthy that, following a quarter of a century of the Corps' presence in Szczecin, we are witnessing another change of command, which symbolises the continuity of the Corps. Freedom needs strength. It will not be able to defend itself. It is a highly valuable concept, but in the context of daily threats, it requires a unified determination and courage.

Never. I know and realize that there are no words that could encompass the pain of losing a husband, father or son. These are soldiers and civilian employees of the Polish Army.

In the author's opinion, expenditure on servicing the FWSZ debt should not be included in defence expenditure, but in the part of the state budget related to debt servicing.",

One cannot complain that the Korean industry delivers equipment in even minimal, drip tranches to a country that is asking for accelerated deliveries. In the second case, the society expects information that the process of strengthening the Polish Army with weapons is underway. In October this year, there were two more deliveries covering K2GF tanks, K9A1 gun-howitzers and Homar-K launcher modules.",

PLN 14.6 billion gross) regarding the acquisition of 48 FA-50 Fighting Eagle light combat aircraft for the Air Force, including 12 FA-50GF (Gap Filler) bridging versions and 36 FA-50PL versions adapted to Polish requirements. All ordered FA-50GFs were delivered to Poland between July 9 and November 26, 2023, while FA-50PLs were to be delivered in 2025-2028, according to the agreement. Since this purchase is still controversial, it is worth familiarizing yourself with some additional information on it, provided to the editorial office by the Air Force Inspectorate of the General Command of the Armed Forces.",
